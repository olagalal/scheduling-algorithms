[![Shields.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-college%20project-orange?style=flat)](http://shields.io/)

This project includes implementation of two OS scheduling algorithms **Shorts Job First** and **Round Robin**. 

### Inputs 
- Number of processes
- Process number (id)
- Arrival time for each process
- Service time for each process
- Quantum (for RR)

### Output
- Finish time for each process
- Waiting time for each process
- Turn around time for each process
- Average waiting time
- Average turn around time

Also output a Gantt Chart (for SJF). I used Java Swing Drag and Drop to build the GUI. This project was made for **(Operating Systems - Forth Year)** in my college.
